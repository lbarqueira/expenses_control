## Gradle Documentation
[The Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#gradle_wrapper)
I could not retrive SHA-1 by command $ ./gradlew signingReport  
I had to upgrade the Gradle Wrapper using $ ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.0.1, however the build did not work and I had to downgrade to 6.7.1  
$ ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=6.7.1  
To see the version of gradle:  
$ ./gradlew --version  

$ ./gradlew signingReport works ok!  


## Flutter's build modes

### Debug
During a typical development cycle, you test an app using flutter run at the command line, or by using the Run and Debug options in your IDE. By default, Flutter builds a debug version of your app.

$ flutter build apk --debug  
Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk.


### Release
- [Flutter - Build and Release an Android App | App Signing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1fByAsqQRk)
- [Build and release an Android app](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android)
- [Signing the app](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#signing-the-app)  
    - Create an upload keystore:
  ```$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore c:/30daysofflutter/upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload```  
    - Reference the keystore from the app - create (project)/android/key.properties   
    - Configure signing in gradle - Configure gradle to use your upload key when building your app in release mode by editing the (project)/android/app/build.gradle file

    - $ ./gradlew signingReport - to get the release SHA-1 and SHA256 - include the two in Firebase (/android directory)
    - $ cd .. (project directory)
    - $ flutter clean
    - $ flutter pub get
    - $ flutter build apk
    - $ flutter install (with device USB connected)
